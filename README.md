This is a crud app that I built in order to save quick notes with markdown.

## Login Page

This is the login page of the app, for this project I wanted to learn NextAUTH so that's what I'm using here. I chose to use the GitHub provider. The styling for this app is the product of me playing around with gradients and blurs.

## Mobile Login

Code Snippets is a desktop app! This application is better suited for desktop, as that's where most programming happens. However, I always keep mobile responsiveness in mind, so it is compatible. Here's what it looks like.

## Writing A Snippet

![Mobile Example](/images/projects/code-snippets/mobile-example.png)

This page contains the main content for the app. Here you can create a snippet, give it a name and save it under a certain topic for organization's sake.

Once users login, they are greeted with a blank canvas, and anything that happens here is saved to the database. If you're curious, you can try it out [here](https://code-snippets-com.vercel.app/).

## Writing A Snippet

![Desktop Example](/images/projects/code-snippets/desktop-tRPC-topic.png)

To write a snippet, simply give it a name and start typing Markdown. Syntax highlighting and auto-completion are present to make the experience feel more like the user's IDE.

## Example Snippet

This is what a Snippet looks like when the user comes back to it. After all, it's just Markdown.

## Multiple Snippets

Through time, this is what the app will look like. Nice and organized code snippets. Here under my React Code topic, I have various examples and notes as reminders. Topics and Snippets can be deleted by clicking on the trash icon.

## Bullet Points:

- This is a code snippet app that I built to practice more with Next, NextAUTH, and Relational Databases with an ORM like Prisma.
- Code Snippets is built with Next, Supdabase, Prisma, tRPC, and NextAUTH.
- I plan to add some features in the future, but for now I'm happy with where this project is at.
- I am using Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI for styling, the custom theme is the result of me messing around.

## The Goal:

The main goal with this project was to practice with the newest web dev tech. I'm trying to master this tech stack, and become a professional React dev. I also wanted to challenge myself to construct a UI that was different from the other apps/sites that I've built.

## What I've learned:

The main thing that I learned from this project was just how powerful tRPC can be when coupled with Prisma in a Nextjs web-app. This entire project was a learning experience and I will be referring back to this repo for reminders in the future.
